# Sec-Tools
Sec-Tools is a script created in python that allows you to install cybersecurity tools more quickly on other systems (Ubuntu etc...)

This is the final version of the script, it is of course asked to run a terminal as root before launching it

Here is the preview of the script:

⚠️Attention⚠️ I would not tolerate that someone has skid my script. I would obviously like you not to copy-paste my script and change the author names. Thanks very much.
